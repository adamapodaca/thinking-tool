# Thinking Tool

## What is this project?
A web-based thinking tool that helps users capture, structure, and revisit ideas.
It has two modes:
1. **Talk Mode** - A guided conversation that helps users think through ideas
2. **Map Mode** - A visual canvas showing the structure of ideas (future feature)

## Who is this for?
- Built for Adam first, then for anyone who struggles with keeping ideas alive through distractions
- Users may not have technical backgrounds

## Tech stack
- Plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no frameworks)
- Local storage for saving data (no backend server yet)

## Code style
- Keep code simple and well-commented — this is a learning project
- Prefer readable code over clever code
- Use descriptive variable names

## How to run
- Open index.html in a browser
